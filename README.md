## Word-Guess-Game
This is a hangman style game designed around the theme of Harry Potter!

Users must type any letter to get started and will have 10 guesses to deduce the themed word.

The game will show dashes where each letter should be. The dashes or blanks will be filled in as the user presses a correct key or letter.

Players will also see a countdown of the number of guesses remaining, as well as a list of the letters already guessed to help track their progress.

When a user correctly guesses a word, their score will be updated under the "Wins" section and the Harry Potter theme music will play.
