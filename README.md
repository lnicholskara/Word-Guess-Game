### Word-Guess-Game

This is a hangman style game designed around the theme of Harry Potter!

Users must type any letter to get started and will have 10 guesses to deduce the themed word.

The game will show dashes where each letter should be. The dashes or blanks will be filled in as the user presses a correct letter.

Players will also see a countdown of the number of guessing remaining, as well as a list the letters already guessed to help track their progress.

When a user correctly guesses a word, their score will be updated under the "Wins" section.
