//Computer selects random word as default.

//Listen for user keystroke

//Store that value in a variable

//Compare that value to the word - if match, show on screen - else remove guess and include under letters guessed

//Continue or loop logic through all guesses

//If all letters guessed win + increase wins count

//Else automatically restart game
